## Introduction
Eatssentials is a web-based application that can be hosted on any browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.). The website was inspired to help users with  health conditions such as diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, mineral deficiencies, and high/low cholesterol by searching the web for meals that they can make based on the list of foods in their refridgerator. First users will take a survey displayed on the dashboard of their health conditions and check which ever applies. Then users will be redirected to a page where they will one by one insert the items inside their fridge. Finally our website will search the web using the Spoonacular API for recipes that the user can make based around their health conditions and items in their fridge.
